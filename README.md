# Return to Twitter Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension I made that removes X garbage on Twitter, it only uses 2 lines of CSS and 2 lines of JS to work.
Keep in mind I kinda just made this for fun and it doesn't have any self-update functionality to it so if it ever breaks you'll have to reinstall it through a new release.

As of right now, the extension is not available on the Google Chrome Store, so if you'd like to install it you'll need to do it manually, so here's what you're going to need to do in order to install it.

1.  Download the latest release of the extension on the releases tab of this repository labeled "Source Code (zip)"
2.  Unzip the folder called `extension` and place it somewhere where it won't get tampered with or deleted
3.  Go to the extensions page on Chrome `chrome://extensions/`
4.  Enable Developer Mode by ticking the slider on the top right corner of the screen
5.  Click the `Load Unpacked` button on the top left corner of the screen
6.  Locate and select the extension folder

Once this is finished the extension should be installed, feel free to disable Developer Mode now that the extension is installed.
